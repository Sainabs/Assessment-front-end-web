    <p1>Hi, I'm Sainab Sahal, I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I have worked in mental health and public health field, where I handled clients' mental and physical health as I provided support throughout their recovery, and while I really enjoy the work that I do, I’d love the chance to dig deeper within the tech industry, which is why I’m so excited about this opportunity with Perficient. In my freetime I like to hike, garden, and play basketball. My career goals are to become a software engineer,and product development. my career interests are managing and delivering products and programs.</p1>
